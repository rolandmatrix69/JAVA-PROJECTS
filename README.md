# Java Learning Repository

This repository is a personal learning workspace created solely for the purpose of studying and mastering the Java programming language. It contains examples, exercises, experimental code, and small projects used for practice and learning. It is not intended to be production-ready software.

## Purpose (short)
- Primary goal: Learn Java fundamentals, intermediate concepts, and common tools by doing.
- Secondary goal: Build a small portfolio of practice projects and exercises demonstrating understanding.

## What you'll find here
- Small Java programs and exercises (beginner to intermediate).
- Project skeletons used for learning (Maven/Gradle samples, simple Spring Boot demos when applicable).
- Notes, scratch code, and experiments. Code may be intentionally simple, unoptimized, or educationally verbose.

## Important notes for visitors
- This repository is for learning only. Do not use any code here as-is in production.
- The code may contain incomplete features, rough edges, or insecure patterns used for demonstration.
- No guarantees of code quality, security, or stability are provided.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Browse folders for exercises or projects you want to try.
3. Run projects locally after reviewing the README inside each project folder (some projects may require JDK 17+ or a specific build tool).

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome if they help explain concepts, fix obvious typos, or improve educational value.
- If you open a pull request, please describe the learning purpose of the change and keep examples small and focused.

## License
Unless otherwise specified in a project subfolder, code in this repo is provided for educational purposes. If you want a more permissive license for a particular subproject, add a LICENSE file in that subfolder or open an issue to discuss.

If you'd like, I can also prepend this notice to each project folder's README automatically or generate a short CONTRIBUTING.md tailored for learners. Tell me what you'd prefer.
